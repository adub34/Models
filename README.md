# Models
Financial Models By Adrian Wilburn.
I will be modeling companies I think are doing new and exciting stuff.
The goal is to become better at modeling and understanding companies. 
This will also help build a personal collection of proprietary models that I can reference and update in the future. 
I will keep the most updated versions of my models on Github. Only completed models.
I do not have a strong focus on formatting but will work to make all models readable.
Down the line as I have developed a strong portfolio of models I will incorporate more advanced analysis, formatting, and data techniques.
All feedback is appreciated. I can be reached at adrianwilburn@icloud.com with any questions, suggestions or criticicisms.

Sector Focus and Models Completed:

Consumer:

Mining:
Manufacturing:
